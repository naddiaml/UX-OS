# Introduction

Hi! I'm Nadia :woman_technologist:, a **constant learner of Web Development**.
In this part of my learning journey, I had to face a new challenge: creating a website using the main Front-End Development technologies.

## UX · OS

**UX · OS** is the website of a company that provides their clients with different services oriented to the creation of digital products.

>They offer a **complete development cycle**, which includes design services, integration and application management, leading the entire development process of the mobile application,
from its concept, ideation and design to its delivery and subsequent support.

### Project's Objective
The objective of this project is to present on a website all the information necessary for the company's recruitment: 
- Offered services,
